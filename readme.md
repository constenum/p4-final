# P4: Final Project

## Description
This project is an application for tutoring session tracking. It will allow tutors to record the
tutoring sessions with students. The sessions will record the student information, tutor information,
and subject. Reports will be added that will allow for administration and tutors to view the number
of sessions and sessions per subject.

## Details for teaching team
For the packages, I used [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) and
[rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer](https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer) which I installed using
Composer, and [fzaninotto/faker](https://packagist.org/packages/fzaninotto/faker),
which is now included in Laravel was used in the ModelFactory.

Currently the ability to enter a students card number to log a session does not work. You must use the
student number to log a session.

The web pages were validated using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
and the CSS stylesheet was validated using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
The website was tested on a MacBook Pro, using Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and on a Windows 10
laptop using Chrome and Firefox.
